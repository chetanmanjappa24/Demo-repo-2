      # Choosing the right container image for your scan can be important. 
      # All Debricked images are here: https://hub.docker.com/r/debricked/cli

      # Resolution images (contains "resolution" in tag) are bigger, but comes with a lot of pre-installed package managers: 
      # Here are the dockerfiles: https://github.com/debricked/cli/tree/main/build/docker
      # This is the easiest way to integrate, but it may be better 
      # to run debricked scans in you build images. 

      # You can choose between debian and alpine images, where we do alpine by default. 
      # We recommend to use debian images for scanning Python projects, as the scanner will not 
      # need to compile some common c-based dependencies like pandas.

      # Here I make demonstrate how to do two separate scans with debricked in different parts of the repo
      # This will create two separate repos in the debricked tool, and can be managed
      # with different policies etc. 
      # You can also split these out to two separate actions to make the results easier to consume visually.
